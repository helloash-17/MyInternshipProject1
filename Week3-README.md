# MyInternshipProjects

This Python script generates highly secure and complex passwords, designed to bolster online security by incorporating a mix of characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
Characteristics of the Generated Password:
A default minimum length of 16 characters (you can adjust this according to your needs).
At least two uppercase letters (A-Z).
At least two lowercase letters (a-z).
At least two digits (0-9).
At least two special symbols or characters.

# How It Works

Character Sets:
The script defines sets of characters for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.

Minimum Requirements:
At least two characters are randomly selected from each character set to ensure the generated password meets the minimum complexity requirements.

Temporary Password:
The selected characters are combined to create a temporary password of 8 characters.

Additional Characters:
The script then randomly selects additional characters from the combined list to reach the desired password length (default is 16 characters).

Shuffling:
To enhance security, the characters are shuffled to prevent predictable patterns in the password.

Final Password:
The shuffled characters are combined to form the final password, which is then displayed on the console.

# Usage

You can modify the password_length variable to generate passwords of different lengths.
This script serves as a valuable tool to strengthen your cybersecurity practices, creating robust and unique passwords for securing your digital accounts.

Note:This is a command-line script. If you intend to use it in your projects or integrate it into other applications, you can customize and adapt the code as needed.

Feel free to modify the script to meet your specific requirements or incorporate it into your own projects. The flexibility of the code allows for easy adaptation based on individual needs.
