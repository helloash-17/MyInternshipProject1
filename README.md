Week-01

This Python script geanerates a To do list application in command prompt. With this application we can do the following tasks :-

Add Tasks :- Users can add new tasks to the to-do list. Each task takes a description and can be assigned a due date or priority.

Task List Display :- There is a option to display the list of tasks, including details like task description, due date, and priority.

Task Completion :- Users can mark tasks as completed, which will move them to a separate completed tasks list.

Update Tasks :- Users can update task descriptions, due dates, or priorities.

Remove Tasks :- Also users can remove unwanted or finished tasks.

#How it works

1.Adding Tasks :- The function takes input for task details like description, due date, and priority and then adds a dictionary representing the task to the tasks list.

2.Task List Display :- It iterates through the tasks list and prints the task details.

3.Task Completion :- It allows users to mark tasks as completed.

4.Updating Tasks :- It provides the option to update task descriptions, due dates, or priorities.

5.Removing Tasks:- It allows users to remove tasks from the list.

6.Menu and User Interaction :- Menu helps the user to interact with application. And the loop continuously display the menu and takes user input.

#Usage

Usage on to-do tasks refers to the way in which tasks are used in a to-do list. This can include things like:

How tasks are created and prioritized. Is there a more structured process? Are tasks prioritized based on importance, due date, or something else?

How tasks are organized. Are tasks grouped together into lists or projects? Are subtasks used to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones?

How tasks are tracked and completed. Are tasks marked as complete when they are finished,  Are tasks due dates and reminders used to stay on track?
